        Stretchy Buoys Jam 2025
    </h1>
    <p class="game-prose"><span>
        Stretchy Buoys Jam was a week-long game jam that took place in an AirBnB in downtown Milwaukee in early January of 2025. Midwest indie devs from Minnesota, Milwaukee, and Michigan participated. The official themes were &ldquo;Folk Heroes&rdquo; and &ldquo;Parallel Worlds&rdquo;. Our goal was to connect each of the four games we produced in a shared play experience. Every game references one another and passcodes can be collected to use in Stretchy Kart. We were fueled by numerous Italian Beefs from Glorioso&rsquo;s, the Italian market across the street.

        &#8203;&#8203;For SPIDER ROLLS I repurposed a 3D platformer into a twin stick shooter. The running and jumping are separate from the aiming and shooting to make the player choose based on their current situation. The game fully came together after introducing the rolling enemies. Thanks Dan Miller for helping me implement their boids algorithm.

    <p class="game-prose">
        I really like hero moments and there are a few. If you play this game after reading this please try: jumping into the air aiming and shooting at the eye or climbing onto the downed spider. Tap the jump button to clamber over to the other side!

        Ian: I spent the first two days of the jam trying to make a true 3d renderer in Pico-8 to draw the track. It produced some really cool visuals (see gif) but was super janky and I couldn&rsquo;t get it to run at more than 2 frames per second! Ultimately I switched to a more performant pseudo 3D closer to the style of games like Outrun or F1 Race. It&rsquo;s not a thematically deep game, but it was a fun technical and design challenge within Pico-8. The game&rsquo;s hot dogs are Vienna Beef brand, shoutout Chicago.

    <p class="game-prose">Dream Tides follows our parallel worlds theme to pay homage to each of the other games in this jam. You wake up on a mysterious island inhabited by characters from the other jam games and comfort them by entering their dreams. The island itself is grey but through each character&rsquo;s dream you get to see it from a new perspective. Just as quickly as you appear on this island you discover that it will fade away. </p>
    <p class="game-prose">Anthony: I used this game to explore a bunch of different visual styles for some upcoming game ideas. I&rsquo;ve also spent the last year building live audio reactive visuals in Unity and got a chance to incorporate those shaders into a game which felt really cool. I also rarely add story or plot to my games so this was a way to put some light humor and emotion into one. When I started the jam my main goal was to attempt visual styles and story while tying all the other games together and I&rsquo;m really happy with how it turned out.</p>
    <p class="game-extra-features">Feature I&rsquo;d add if I had more time: I wanted to add more characters and let you modify their thoughts and relationships when you were in their dreams.</p>

    <p class="game-headline">Boid Golf is a physics puzzle game where flocks try to find the way into their Nest. Guide flocks with as few obstacles as possible to get the best score on each of the 9 puzzles. Learn how the flocks behave and unlock free play mode at the end. Control by clicking and dragging the obstacles inside the red zone.</p>
    <p class="game-prose">Dan: I knew I wanted to make a flocking simulation, but wasn&#39;t initially sure how to make a game around it. After playing with a working simulation I settled on a golf-style puzzle. As a result this game is a toy first and a puzzler second, which is why I included a free play level at the end. I hope that if you enjoy the puzzles then you will also enjoy exploring the simulation in free play! Thanks to Ian for convincing me to snap the obstacles to a grid.</p>
    <p class="game-prose">The graphical style is a result of early technical choices. The Boids track only the closest obstacle, which are modeled as signed distance functions (SDF). On the 5th day of the jam I decided to write a custom SDF renderer to display the color of the closest obstacle for each pixel. This allows the player to see exactly the same world the Boids do!</p>

    <p class="game-extra-features">Feature I&#39;d add if I had more time: I feel that the Boids should be singing, I would like to see them create procedural music based on their movement patterns.</p>

    <p class="game-prose">&#8203;&#8203;I was initially just playing around with Godot to learn the engine better and to take a break from making music for the jam. But, then the ideas started flowing and I decided to make a car game inspired by Yume Nikki and the game Ian was working on, and kindof&nbsp;ignoring the jam themes. I was initially going with an early Google SketchUp (flat shaded) look, but didn&rsquo;t entirely end up sticking with that beyond using simple shapes and zero textures. Figured dealing with primitives and zero textures would be easiest for my first proper Godot game. I&rsquo;ve usually used Unity for the past decade, but overall I love Godot. Some things here or there that I maybe wish were built-in or designed a little better, but a lot more things that feel a lot more intuitive and snappy to work with.</p>
    <p class="game-prose">I worked very on and off for a few weeks post-jam to finish the game up, but I started work on this game a few days late into the jam, so I figure it mainly evens out. I actually wasn&rsquo;t so sure at the beginning of the game jam if I was feeling the jam vibes. I had just come from a month-long spree of daily video game playing (checking stuff off my backlog), and so kinda wanted to keep doing that when I first got into Milwaukee. But once I started fiddling around with Godot proper and we had a nice outing as a group midway through, then I was feeling it. I even got to take the new-ish Milwaukee streetcar, called The Hop. And I had a few good games of pool that night, along with some good drinks and good company.</p>

        class="inline-image left">
    <p class="game-prose">Anyways, back to the game, another inspiration was the open world racing game, Road Trip Adventure. I liked how much you could freely explore the world between races, and thought those vibes fit with the Yume Nikki design ethos, so I added a very rudimentary racing system to the game with laps and everything. I initially designed the car to just look petite and cute, but it ended up making me think of toys and childhood memories. I remembered playing with toy cars on those road play rugs and plastic race tracks. And I remember long drives in the family vehicle around Wisconsin. And I figured these memories worked well as the backbone of the game. How well that translates to the actual game, I&rsquo;m not sure. I could only add so much. But I&rsquo;m happy with how it turned out.</p>
